hello this is an introduction
my name is roshini

im writing this on a thinkpad
i don't really like how the mouse buttons of the touchpad are above the touchpad.
i don't understand the purpose of that it's annoying
i'm 17 and an architecture major, my favorite color is brown and purple and computer programming is cool

additional change: my favorite hobby right now is playing hitman 3 it's pretty awesome
